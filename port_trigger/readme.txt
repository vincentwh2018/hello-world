^_^, hope you will enjoy it.
1) first, run make
   you will get the executive program server and client
2) you can input command make client just for client 
   Also, 'make server' for server.

The default triggering port is 1024 with openning port 1127.
The server ip address is '10.0.0.1'.
You can change this config in the source code.

Sorry for no configuration file.


Test procedure.
1) Running server in the remote peer. (Wan side).
2) Running client in the local peer. (Lan side)
3) You can get 'Connection successfully' in the local side output.
